# UFOs - Interactive Webpage
## Project Overview
### Purpose of the analysis
This project aims to help Dana, a data journalist, showcase her UFO-sighting information by implementing JavaScript and HTML to create a webpage displaying the UFOs data as a table, wherein the data can be filtered by the user-input criteria such as date, city, state, country, and UFO's shape.

## Project Summary

### Drawback of the Webpage Design
+ The design of the filter section is not clear, there is no button for the user to click, such as "Apply Filter" or "Filter Table" button that indicates the application of the input filters when pressing enter on the keyboard.

### Recommendations for Further Development
+ We can modify the scripts to display a message such as "No Results Found, please try another search" instead of displaying a blank table for the no-match results when the input filter does not match with any data in the database.
+ For the filter section, a dropdown list can also be added for each filter to guide users of the filter options, as well as two addtional buttons, one to "Apply Filter(s)", and another one to "Clear All Filter(s)".
